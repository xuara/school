<p class="title">Background</p>
<p class="para">It all started in 1958 during the Manhattan Project where William Higinbotham created a game called “Tennis for Two” to try and lighten up the workplace. Although “Tennis for Two” is widely considered to be the first game, it barely constitutes as a video game as it was played on analog computers. It wasn’t until 1962 at MIT when Steve Russell developed “SPACEWARS!” which is the first known video game to be played on multiple computer installations. A couple of years later in 1971, a game called Computer Space, based on “SPACEWARS!”, was developed by Syzygy Engineering and published by Nutting Associates came about. Computer Space was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney and was the first widely available arcade game. </p>

<p class="para">The year after that, “Pong” appeared. Inspired by Magnavox’s “Table Tennis”, Allan Alcorn designed “Pong” when it was published by Atari. “Pong” was the first sports arcade video game. The first commercial video game console came that same year, the Magnavox Odyssey, but it was not very prosperous. It used overlays to simulate color on television screens and came with dice, poker chips, and score cards for the twenty-seven games over twelve plug-in cards to add games. The first successful home console didn’t come until 1977 with the Atari 2600, which had an affordable hardware price and started the practice of converting arcade games for home use and had tons of different games. A year later, “Space Invaders” became the first game to record high scores. Then in 1979, “Asteroids” became the first vector-based game. That same year, “Galaxian” became the first full-color game, and the Intellivision by Mattel Electronics which used a trackpad-like controller and used overlays for game controls. </p>

<p class="para">In 1985, the Colecovision combined the best of both worlds (joysticks and keypads), plus exceptional graphics for the time. It wasn’t until 1986 with “The Legend of Zelda” where the ability to allow players to save their game came along. Then starting in 1993, with the fifth generation of gaming, came 3D polygon graphics, optical storage, CD quality audio recordings, and the wide adoption of full motion video, displaying pre-rendered computer animation or even live-action footage. In the sixth generation of gaming, which started in 1998, came the first console with an online component (Sega Dreamcast) and the first console with a hard drive and Ethernet cable (Microsoft Xbox). The seventh generation, starting in 2005, brought wireless controllers and the first console which included Blu-Ray and Bluetooth (PlayStation 3) and started the motion control craze with Nintendo’s Wii console. Lastly, in 2012, the eighth and current generation of gaming’s consoles had voice controls and second screens as well as 3D visuals and touchscreens. With each generation, the technology has improved. </p>
