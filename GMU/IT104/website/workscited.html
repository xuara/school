	This chapter lists efforts throughout the 70s and 80s to regulate the spread of coin-operated video games and arcades. It also connects the efforts to existing regulatory regimens and argues that the emergent technology of video gaming and the games' appeal to youths revived efforts in a lot of communities. The chapter note how the ills ascribed to video game arcades reflect both older anxieties about delinquency in young people alongside newer anxieties about technological changes happening around the nation. Discusses whether or not the policing of video games arises from the debate about what activities should rightly be included as a part of childhood. </p>
