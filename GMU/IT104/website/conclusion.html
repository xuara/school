<p class="title">Conclusion</p>
<p class="para">In the end, video games are a practical miracle of a technology. They have many potential benefits, including aiding in training, educating, and exercise. Video games are also currently used for entertainment and as a means of socialization. Security concerns are scarce and only include the personal information stored with the video games companies. Gamers and their culture have always had a social stigma towards them. Video games have been under ethical scrutiny since their conception. And they have also been under review in a legal context for varied reasons, like barring their sales. Lastly, video games have infinite potential for where they are headed, from all standpointsâ€¦whether technical, social, or beneficial. </p>
