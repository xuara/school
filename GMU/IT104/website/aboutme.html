<h1> About Me </h1>
<h3> By: Michael Kester </h3>
<ul>
<li>I attend George Mason University</li>
<li>I am in the Volgenau School of Engineering's Information Technology Department</li>
<li>I am classified as a junior</li></ul>
<p>
I received my associates degree in computer science but realized that I did not want to continue down that route and decided to go into IT instead. This is my first semester at GMU since I transferred here from NVCC. I have always enjoyed technology, even as a kid, so because of that I have naturally become tech-savvy. I hope to turn that into a career... As far as programming languages go, most of my experience is with Java. However, I have had a little exposure to Python and HTML in the past. I have a tenuous plan of choosing cybersecurity as my IT major specialization, but I'll just have to wait and see how things go to determine whether or not that will change.
