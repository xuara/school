<p class="title">Security Concerns</p>
<p class="para">Concerns regarding video games and security are few and far between. The most probable scenario concerning this isn’t directly tied to the video games themselves, but instead regarding the technology that comes with them: credit card information stored on the servers of video game companies. Hackers could force their way into these servers and obtain millions of people’s credit card information, names, addresses, and other personal information. Thanks to the advent of digital distribution of games, online stores like the PlayStation Store are constantly in need of the best security to prevent such attacks. Personal information being stored with video game companies leaking out is basically the only security concern regarding a technology whose primary purpose is simply to entertain. </p>
