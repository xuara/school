<p class="title">Ethical and Social Implications and Legal Issues</p>
<p class="para">Ever since the rise of video games’ popularity, there have always been people questioning the ethical implications of them. With video games pouring out into other forms of mainstream media with movies like Death Race 2000 where, in a post-apocalyptic society, the national sport is a game where people run over pedestrians for points. A video game aptly called “Death Race” based on that game in the movie came out, which lead to moral outrage. “For moral guardians suspicious of or hostile to the budding culture of video gaming, Death Race became the most prominent example of video games’ depravity and corrupting influence” (Kocurek “Adapting Violence”, 68). </p>

<p class="para">There are numerous social implications regarding video games. When they first came about, gamers and their culture had a stigma to them. “The same regulations intended to prevent youths from cutting class or spending lunch money on pinball games also stigmatized the games, connecting pinball in public discourse with youth delinquency and antisocial behaviors” (Kocurek “Anarchy in the Arcade”, 97). Gamers were, and still are although to a much lesser degree, practically seen as the scum of society – degenerates who don’t do anything productive. </p>

<p class="para">From a legal perspective, video games have been in the spotlight a few times. One such instance is when California decided to bar the sales of violent video games to minors. “The California law, passed in 2005…defines violent video games as those depicting “killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being”” (Walsh, 22-23). Video games have gone through many such legal reviews, from regulating their sale to defining what exactly a video game is. </p>
